# Next.js 15 Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with page navigation in Next.js 15 when using the `useRouter` hook.  Specifically, transitions between pages might not always be smooth, exhibiting flickering or incomplete rendering.

## Problem Description

The `about.js` page uses the `useRouter` hook to navigate back to the home page.  In certain scenarios, the navigation might not be seamless. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the About page using the link on the home page.
5. Click the button to return to the home page and observe the behavior.

## Potential Causes and Solutions

* **Asynchronous operations:** Ensure all data fetching is properly handled to avoid race conditions that might cause UI inconsistencies during the routing process.
* **Client-side routing:** Verify the correct use of `router.push` method. In some cases, using `router.replace` might provide a smoother transition.
* **React state management:**  If you are using a state management solution, ensure the state updates correctly after the navigation completes.
* **Component lifecycle:** Pay close attention to component lifecycle methods (such as `componentWillUnmount`) to clean up resources and prevent memory leaks that could cause routing hiccups.
